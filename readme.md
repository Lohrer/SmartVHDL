Sublime Text 'Smart' VHDL Package
==================================


Description
-----------

Syntax highlighting is based on the VHDL bundle for Textmate.

But it now includes :
 - a proper symbol definition for easy code navigation
 - the basic indentation definition
 - some scope change to be aligned with my other plugin for SystemVerilog
 - More snippets written by https://github.com/ccornish
 - Tooltip to get signal definition on mouse hover

Note: the default color scheme (Monokai) is missing a lot of scope, and might not give the best results.
You can try my personal variation of Sunburst : https://bitbucket.org/Clams/sublimesystemverilog/downloads/Sunburst2.tmTheme
